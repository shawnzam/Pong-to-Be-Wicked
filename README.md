- Magical enchanted forest game environment
- Sparkly effects and glowing ball
- Dynamic ball physics - the angle changes based on where the ball hits the paddle

## New Features

- **Transition Screen**: After Player 1 selects their character, a 3-second transition screen displays their choice with animations and firework effects. Players can skip this screen using space/enter (desktop) or tap (mobile).
- **Countdown Screen**: After Player 2 selects their character, a 3-second countdown screen appears, showing both characters with a "VS" graphic and countdown numbers. Firework effects and a "Get Ready!" message are included. Players can skip this screen using space/enter (desktop) or tap (mobile).
- **Improved AI Logic**: In single-player mode, the AI tracks the ball's vertical position, moves at 55% of the player's paddle speed, and includes a reaction delay of 32 pixels for more realistic gameplay.

## Single-Player Mode Instructions

- **Player 1 (Mal)**: Use W and S keys to move your paddle up and down.
